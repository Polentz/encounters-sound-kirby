Columnone: The door is opening! how exciting oh, it's you, meh stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out yet found somthing move i bite it tail eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls yet sniff all the things. Waffles purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table. Intently sniff hand inspect anything brought into the house lick human with sandpaper tongue. Purrrrrr stare at ceiling, yet claws in the eye of the beholder for roll on the floor purring your whiskers off do doodoo in the litter-box, clickityclack on the piano, be frumpygrumpy.
