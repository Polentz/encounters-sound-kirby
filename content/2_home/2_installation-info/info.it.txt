Columntwo: Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens eat half my food and ask for more eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants, so munch on tasty moths. Cat walks in keyboard catching very fast laser pointer leave buried treasure in the sandbox for the toddlers. Howl uncontrollably for no reason eats owners hair then claws head but and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not, allways wanting food, hopped up on catnip present belly, scratch hand when stroked warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats. Push your water glass on the floor curl into a furry donut, yet twitch tail in permanent irritation. Inspect anything brought into the house. Ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box poop on the floor, break a planter, sprint, eat own hair, vomit hair, hiss, chirp at birds, eat a squirrel, hide from fireworks,
